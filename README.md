## ✨ Introduction  
This repository is a **learning hub for parallel computing** concepts implemented in C.  
It contains multiple programs (`p1.c` – `p9.c`) and a supporting PDF (`parallel computing.pdf`) that walks through theory and practice.  

Perfect for:  
- 🎓 Students exploring **threads, processes, and concurrency**  
- 🧑‍💻 Developers experimenting with **parallelization**  
- 🔬 Anyone curious about **high-performance computing** basics  

---

## ⚙️ Features  
✔️ Multiple C programs (`p1.c` – `p9.c`) demonstrating parallel techniques  
✔️ Ready-to-compile examples (Linux / macOS / WSL compatible)  
✔️ Includes a supporting PDF with explanations  
✔️ Extendable — add your own experiments  

---

## 📦 Installation  

Clone the repo:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sinchana-K28/Parallel-Computing.git
cd Parallel-Computing

Make sure you have GCC (or Clang) installed:

gcc --version

▶️ Usage

Compile and run:

# Basic compile
gcc -o p1 p1.c
./p1

# With pthreads
gcc -o p2 p2.c -pthread
./p2

# With OpenMP
gcc -o p3 p3.c -fopenmp
./p3

# With MPI
mpicc -o p4 p4.c
mpirun -np 4 ./p4


👉 Replace p1–p9 with the program you want to test.
